<!--The next section to work on is the ‘analytics’.
Meaning, we’re displaying a lot of analytics for the job seeker which will keep them encouraged to keep their profile
enhanced, development, growing.
These analytics will show the job seeker their rate of success, see their rate compared to those others
who are getting the same materials, doing the same thing, and for companies to see how the job seeker is doing.
It’d be great to see how this area is both talked about and designed.
Perhaps then you could work on the Company Profile - what will the page look like once a company  logs in.-->
