Average number of language : 2

"From a study I read recently : Two-thirds of children around the world are raised in bilingual homes (Crystal, 1997)
So, I think itâ€™s safe to say the answer is 2.
2 languages is average, speaking 1 language is somewhat uncommon, and speaking 3 languages is probably becoming more
and more common every day in our increasingly globalized world!"
